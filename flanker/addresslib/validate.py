'''
Validation module that that supports alternate spelling suggestions for
domains, MX record lookup and query, as well as custom local-part grammar for
large ESPs.

This module should probably not be used directly, use
flanker.addresslib.address unles you are building ontop of the library.

Public Functions in flanker.addresslib.validate module:

    * suggest_alternate(addr_spec)

      Given an addr-spec, suggests an alternate if a typo is found. Returns
      None if no alternate is suggested.

    * preparse_address(addr_spec)

      Preparses email addresses. Used to handle odd behavior by ESPs.

    * plugin_for_esp(mail_exchanger)

      Looks up the custom grammar plugin for a given ESP via the mail
      exchanger.

    * mail_exchanger_lookup(domain)

      Looks up the mail exchanger for a given domain.

    * connect_to_mail_exchanger(mx_hosts)

      Attempts to connect to a given mail exchanger to see if it exists.

    Given an addr-spec, suggests a alternate addr-spec if common spelling

    Returns an suggested alternate if one is found. Returns None if the
    address is invalid or no suggestions were found.
